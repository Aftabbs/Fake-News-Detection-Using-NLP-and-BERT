# Fake-News-Detection-Using-NLP-and-BERT
This project focuses on the detection of fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles as either fake or true based on their textual content.
